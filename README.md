A graph neural network is a class of neural network for processing data best represented by graph data structures.
The Graph Data Structures are based on objects called Nodes (and or Vertices) and their relationships called edges.

Each vertex or edge has:
* An ID that is unique across the graph
* A label that represents the type of object
* A set of properties that provide additional attributes.
